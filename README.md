# AWS-Web-Project-1
This project was put on hold, it will showcase a simple web project on AWS. I'll be using Django, Node JS, Kubuntu Linux, and AWS CLI
to deploy it. I paused it because it felt rudimentary compared to building the Terraform IaC project. I would still like to explore Django
and Node JS, so I will return to it soon.
